# Image and Video Processing with Python and OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project implements image and video processing techniques using the **OpenCV** library in Python. It consists of two main scripts:
1. **`project1.py`**: Processes static images by adding watermarks, converting to grayscale, adjusting brightness, performing histogram equalization, adding salt-and-pepper noise, and applying smoothing and sharpening filters.
2. **`video_processing.py`**: Processes real-time video from a webcam, offering effects such as edge detection, grayscale quantization, contrast enhancement, soft appearance, cartoon effect, negative filter, sepia filter, and face smoothing.

### Project Goals
- Apply fundamental and advanced image processing techniques.
- Provide an interactive interface for real-time video processing.
- Display image analysis (e.g., histograms) and statistics.
